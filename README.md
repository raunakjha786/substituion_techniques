# Substitution Encryption and Decryption Algorithms

This project provides a user-friendly GUI for exploring various classical substitution cipher techniques used for encryption and decryption. It includes popular algorithms like Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Hill Cipher, Polyalphabetic Cipher, and the One-Time Pad.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Implements the classical Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption based on shifting characters by a specified number of positions.
- **Monoalphabetic Cipher**: Encrypts and decrypts messages using a fixed substitution where one letter is replaced with another throughout the message.
- **Playfair Cipher**: A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters using a 5x5 grid.
- **Hill Cipher**: A polygraphic cipher based on linear algebra, which encrypts blocks of letters using matrix multiplication.
- **Polyalphabetic Cipher**: Uses multiple substitution alphabets to enhance encryption security.
- **One-Time Pad**: Provides theoretically unbreakable encryption using a random key that is as long as the message.

## User Interface

The graphical user interface (GUI) consists of the following sections:

- **Title**: The main title "Substitution encryption and decryption algos" at the top of the window with icons depicting encryption.
- **Algorithm Buttons**: A list of buttons for each algorithm:
  - **Caesar Cipher**
  - **Monoalphabetic Cipher**
  - **Playfair Cipher**
  - **Hill Cipher**
  - **Polyalphabetic Cipher**
  - **One-Time Pad**
  
  Clicking any button launches the respective cipher encryption and decryption tool.
  
- **Exit Button**: A playful exit prompt at the bottom: "Hey! Do you wanna exit from this mess?" accompanied by an "Exit Application" button to close the program.

- **Footer**: Includes a note by the developer and a link to the full directory in GitHub.

## How to Use

1. Launch the application.
2. Select the cipher you want to explore by clicking on the corresponding button.
3. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Follow the prompts to provide any necessary keys (e.g., shift value for Caesar Cipher).
5. View the encrypted or decrypted message.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12+**
- Libraries used: Tkinter for the GUI, NumPy (for Hill Cipher), and any other relevant libraries for encryption algorithms.
